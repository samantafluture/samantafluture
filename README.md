### Hi there 👋

I started coding for fun as a kid...
After 10 years building interacting experiences and installations 🤖
(while working with SEO & digital design from 9 to 6pm 🙉),
I finally became a very curious Front-End Developer 😍

### aboutMe.js

```javascript
const samanta = {
    pronouns: "she" | "her",
    code: [Javascript, HTML, CSS],
    askMeAbout: ["web dev", "tech", "robotics", "synths", "ramen"],
    technologies: {
        frontEnd: {
            js: [ReactJS, Angular],
            css: ["tailwindcss", "bootstrap", "materialize"]
        },
        backEnd: {
            js: ["next.js", "firebase", "node"],
            devops: ["linux", "docker", "git"]
        },
    }
};
```
