### Hi there 👋

I started coding for fun as a kid... Now, apart from being a very curious and passionate Developer 😍, I love to build robots and beautiful interactive installations 🤖<br>

```javascript
const samanta = {
    pronouns: "she" | "her",
    code: [Javascript, HTML, CSS],
    askMeAbout: ["web dev", "tech", "robotics", "synths", "ramen"],
    technologies: {
        frontEnd: {
            js: [ReactJS, Angular],
            css: ["tailwindcss", "bootstrap", "materialize"]
        },
        backEnd: {
            js: ["next.js", "firebase", "node"],
